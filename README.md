# Fractal

**A flexible tool for building, documenting and integrating website component libraries.**

> _**Important:** Fractal is currently considered to be in beta. Until it reaches a 1.0 release there may be breaking changes in point-releases, as well as out-of date or incorrect documentation. Use at your own risk!_

## Documentation

Fractal documentation is currently very much a work-in-progress. Pages may be placeholders or incomplete.

* [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started.md) (Including installation instructions)
* [Global Configuration](/docs/configuration.md)
* Components
	* [Overview](/docs/components.md)
* Guides
	* [Creating components](/docs/guides/creating-components.md)

## Requirements

Fractal makes use of a number of ES6 features that mean it currently requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v5.0+ to run.

Transpilation may be considered in the future (i.e. when the project is stable) in order to make it compatible with earlier Node versions.

## Credits

Fractal is developed and maintained by [Mark Perkins](http://github.com/allmarkedup) and the dev team at [Clearleft](http://clearleft.com).
