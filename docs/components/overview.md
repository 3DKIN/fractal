# Components

'Component' is a generic term used by Fractal to describe pieces of your website's UI.

**In Fractal everything is a considered a component**. A component could be a tiny chunk of HTML for a text input, it could be a whole page or it could be something in between.

Unlike some other systems, Fractal does not enforce any specific nomenclature or taxonomy on your components - you are free to organise and name them as you wish.

## What makes a component?

In order for Fractal to find your components, they must:

1. Live within the component directory that you specified in your [fractal.js configuration file](/docs/configuration.md).
2. Have a 'view' file, containing HTML (templated or 'vanilla') for rendering your component.

The following points are also worth bearing in mind:

* Components can be organised into directories and sub-directories as required.
* Components can additionally include as many related files (such as JavaScript, CSS, tests and READMEs) as you like.
