# API - Source Objects

Source objects are a special sub-class of [Collection objects](/docs/api/collections.md). Like collections, they represent a set of entities and/or sub-collections. *Unlike* collections however, they also additionally provide source-type specific methods for working with the entities they contain, as well as holding information about the source (directory) itself.

Fractal exposes two different types source objects - a **component source** and a **docs source**.

All methods and properties that are provided by Collection objects are also available on source objects, plus the following additional methods/properties:
