## Fractal v2 docs

Fractal v2 docs are currently a work in progress, but the following should be enough to get started if you are feeling adventurous:

* [Component library structure and file naming conventions](/docs/directory-structure.md)
* [Fractal API](/docs/fractal.md)
* [Entity APIs (components & files)](/docs/entity-apis.md)
* [Entity data schemas (components & files)](/docs/entity-schemas.md)
