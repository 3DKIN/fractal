## Fractal v2 docs

Fractal v2 docs are currently a work in progress, but the following should be enough to get started if you are feeling adventurous:

* [Component library structure and file naming conventions](/docs/directory-structure.md)
* [Fractal API](/docs/fractal.md)
* [Collections](/docs/collections.md)
* [Component and file data schemas](/docs/entity-schemas.md)
