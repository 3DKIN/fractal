<!-- So as a trivial example you could do something like the following to generate an array of items that you can use in your component view template:


```js
var items = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    items.push('Item number ' + i);
}

module.exports = {
	context: {
		listItems: items
	}
};
```

It's also worth noting that files in this format are imported by Fractal as a Node modules. The handy thing about this is that it means that you can `require` whichever files, libraries and NPM modules you like to use in generating your component's preview data.-->
