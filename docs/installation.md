# Installation and basic usage

Fractal is distributed as an NPM module, and currently requires NodeJS v5.0+ to run.

## 1. Install the CLI helper globally

If you have never worked on a Fractal project before, you will first need to install a global Fractal instance to help run commands from the command line. You only need to do this **once per machine**.

```shell
npm i @frctl/fractal -g
```

## 2. Create a new Fractal project

There are a couple of ways to get started with Fractal:

* [Using the quick start repository](#using-the-quick-start-repository)
* [Manual installation](#manual-installation-and-setup)

### Using the quick start repository

The easiest way to get started with Fractal is to grab a copy of the [quick start project boilerplate](https://github.com/frctl/quick-start) from Github and then customise it to fit your needs.

1. Download the [zip file of the quick start repository](https://github.com/frctl/skeleton/archive/master.zip).
2. Unzip into a location of your choosing.
3. Open the project folder in you command line tool of choice.
4. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

See the [frctl/quick-start](https://github.com/frctl/quick-start) repository for more details.

### Manual installation and setup

Fractal needs to be installed as a per-project dependency. If you haven't already, create a new project directory and run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file.

Then install Fractal into your project using the command:

```
npm i @frctl/fractal --save
```

You should then create a `fractal.js` file in the root of your project. This is where you will configure your Fractal instance.

At a bare minimum, this file should `require` the Fractal at the top as follows, and tell Fractal where to find your components directory:

```js
const fractal = require('@frctl/fractal');

fractal.set('components.path', 'path/to/components');
```

## 3. Run commands!

All commands must be run from within the root directory of your project. Commands can be run from the command line using the following format:

```shell
fractal <command> [args] [opts]
```

The default installation of Fractal provides two commands - `start` and `build`:

### Starting the preview web server

The `start` command starts a web server to provide a nice visual way to browse the patterns in your component library. You can start the server from the CLI using the command:

```shell
fractal start
```

### Building a static version of the web preview

If you want to export a static HTML version of the web preview interface, you can use the build command as follows:

```shell
fractal build
```

This will export a static version of the web UI into a directory in the root of your project.
